\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the empirical findings from the comprehensive evaluation of MEMIT across multiple scales, layer configurations, and model architectures. The experimental design tested neural model editing effectiveness across five orders of magnitude (1 to 10,000 edits) on two transformer architectures (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) using two factual knowledge datasets (CounterFact and zsRE). Results demonstrate significant performance variations across experimental conditions, revealing critical insights into the scaling behavior of mass memory editing and optimal layer selection strategies.

\section{Overview of Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results_overview}

The experimental evaluation encompassed 80 distinct configurations, systematically varying model architecture, dataset type, editing scale, and target layer selection. All experiments employed MEMIT with hyperparameters optimized for each model-layer configuration as described in Section~\ref{sec:experimental_setup}. 

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{subsec:evaluation_metrics}

Performance assessment utilized three primary accuracy metrics across both datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rewrite Accuracy} ($A_r$): Proportion of target facts successfully modified to new values
    \item \textbf{Paraphrase Accuracy} ($A_p$): Accuracy on paraphrased versions of edited facts, measuring edit generalization
    \item \textbf{Neighborhood Accuracy} ($A_n$): Accuracy on related but unedited facts, assessing preservation of relevant knowledge
\end{itemize}

For CounterFact experiments, additional metrics provided comprehensive evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Success Rates}: Binary indicators of editing effectiveness ($S_r$, $S_p$, $S_n$)
    \item \textbf{Score Differences}: Magnitude of logit changes from baseline ($D_r$, $D_p$, $D_n$)
    \item \textbf{Reference Score}: Composite measure of knowledge preservation ($R_s$)
    \item \textbf{N-gram Entropy}: Language model fluency preservation ($H_{ng}$)
    \item \textbf{Overall Score}: Weighted combination of all metrics ($S_{overall}$)
\end{itemize}

\midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{Llama-3.1-8B} & CounterFact & $85.69 \pm 28.44$ & $71.83 \pm 36.12$ & $31.47 \pm 24.89$ \\
 & zsRE & $77.18 \pm 35.72$ & $79.40 \pm 32.68$ & $38.92 \pm 28.43$ \\
\midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{DeepSeek-R1} & CounterFact & $52.47 \pm 42.38$ & $39.84 \pm 35.64$ & $9.12 \pm 14.27$ \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Model Architecture Effects}: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct demonstrated superior editing performance across all metrics compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. On CounterFact, Llama achieved $85.69\%$ rewrite accuracy versus $52.47\%$ for DeepSeek, representing a 63.3\% relative improvement. Paraphrase accuracy showed even larger gaps ($71.83\%$ vs $39.84\%$, 80.2\% relative improvement), indicating better generalization of edits in Llama.

\textbf{Dataset-Specific Patterns}: Both models exhibited different performance profiles across datasets. Llama maintained high rewrite accuracy on both datasets but showed improved paraphrase performance on zsRE ($79.40\%$ vs $71.83\%$). Conversely, DeepSeek demonstrated significantly degraded performance on zsRE compared to CounterFact across all metrics.

\subsection{Dataset Performance Analysis}
\label{subsec:dataset_performance}

Figure~\ref{fig:dataset_comparison} illustrates the performance differences between CounterFact and zsRE datasets across both model architectures.

The stark performance differences highlight dataset-specific challenges in neural model editing.}
\label{fig:dataset_comparison}
\end{figure}

\textbf{CounterFact Characteristics}: The CounterFact dataset, designed specifically for fact verification tasks, enabled more effective editing across both architectures. Llama achieved near-perfect rewrite accuracy (85-100\% across scales) with substantial paraphrase generalization. DeepSeek showed more variable performance but maintained reasonable rewrite success rates.

\textbf{zsRE Complexity}: The zero-shot relation extraction format of zsRE proved more challenging for both models. Llama maintained strong performance with improved paraphrase accuracy, suggesting better handling of the relation extraction format. DeepSeek experienced severe performance degradation on zsRE, with rewrite accuracy dropping to 21.89\% overall.

\section{Scaling Behavior Analysis}
\label{sec:scaling_analysis}

\subsection{Performance Degradation with Scale}
\label{subsec:performance_degradation}

Table~\ref{tab:scaling_behavior} documents the systematic performance degradation as editing scale increases from 1 to 10,000 simultaneous modifications.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption[MEMIT Performance Scaling Behavior]{Performance degradation of MEMIT as a function of editing scale. Results show mean accuracy across optimal layer configurations for each model-dataset combination. Values in parentheses represent percentage change from single-edit baseline.}
\label{tab:scaling_behavior}
\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}

 & Neighborhood & $40.0$ & $18.0$ & $12.9$ & $0.2$ & $0.04$ \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{\makecell{DeepSeek\\zsRE}} & Rewrite & $100.0$ & $95.2$ & $31.2$ & $31.7$ & $0.4$ \\

 & Neighborhood & $70.8$ & $44.1$ & $31.9$ & $33.6$ & $4.1$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Critical Scaling Thresholds}: Both models exhibited distinct scaling regimes with critical transition points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Small Scale (1-10 edits)}: Near-perfect rewrite accuracy maintained across all conditions
    \item \textbf{Medium Scale (100 edits)}: Llama maintained excellent performance; DeepSeek began degradation
    \item \textbf{Large Scale (1000 edits)}: Llama showed first degradation signs; DeepSeek experienced severe failure
    \item \textbf{Massive Scale (10,000 edits)}: Both models showed substantial performance loss
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Differential Scaling Behavior}: Llama demonstrated superior scaling robustness, maintaining reasonable performance through 1000 edits. DeepSeek exhibited an abrupt transition to near-zero performance between 100 and 1000 edits, suggesting fundamental capacity limitations.

\subsection{Memory Interference Effects}
\label{subsec:memory_interference}

Figure~\ref{fig:scaling_curves} illustrates the relationship between editing scale and performance degradation across different metrics.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/scaling_curves.png}
\caption[MEMIT Performance Scaling Curves]{Performance scaling curves showing accuracy degradation as a function of editing scale. Panel A shows Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct results for CounterFact, Panel B shows Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct results for zsRE, Panel C shows DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B results for CounterFact, and Panel D shows DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B results for zsRE. Solid lines represent rewrite accuracy, dashed lines represent paraphrase accuracy, and dotted lines represent neighborhood accuracy. The curves reveal distinct scaling regimes and critical transition points where editing effectiveness collapses.}
\label{fig:scaling_curves}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Neighborhood Degradation}: Neighborhood accuracy exhibited the steepest decline across all conditions, indicating that memory interference primarily affects related knowledge preservation rather than target fact modification. This pattern suggests that MEMIT successfully modifies target associations but struggles to maintain the broader knowledge context.

\textbf{Model-Specific Interference}: Llama showed gradual degradation with maintained performance through medium scales, while DeepSeek demonstrated brittle behavior with sharp performance cliffs. The difference suggests architectural factors influence interference susceptibility.

\textbf{Optimal Layer Selection}: Results revealed model-specific optimal layer configurations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Llama-3.1}: Layers 3-7 provided optimal performance on CounterFact (92.3\% overall score), while layers 1-6 achieved best results on zsRE (97.2\% rewrite, 98.1\% paraphrase accuracy)
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek}: Layers 4-8 yielded best results on CounterFact (84.7\% overall score), while layer selection had minimal impact on zsRE performance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Layer Range Effects}: Early layers (1-5/1-6) generally underperformed compared to middle layers, suggesting that factual knowledge storage occurs primarily in intermediate feed-forward networks. Late layers (13-17) showed degraded performance, particularly for Llama, indicating that deeper layers may be less suitable for factual editing.

Figure~\ref{fig:layer_comparison} provides a detailed comparison of layer selection effects across both model architectures.

The results demonstrate clear optimal layer ranges for each architecture and highlight the importance of proper layer selection for editing effectiveness.}
\label{fig:layer_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Causal Tracing Correlation Analysis}
\label{subsec:causal_correlation}

The layer selection optimization results were analyzed in conjunction with causal tracing experiments (Chapter~\ref{ch:methodology}) to validate the relationship between causal effects and editing performance.

\textbf{Layer Effect Correspondence}: Optimal editing layers (3-7 for Llama, 4-8 for DeepSeek) corresponded closely to layers showing highest causal effects in the causal tracing analysis. This correlation validates the causal tracing methodology as an effective approach for layer selection in neural model editing.

\textbf{Model Architecture Differences}: The shift in optimal layers between models (3-7 vs 4-8) reflects architectural differences in knowledge representation and processing between Llama-3.1 and DeepSeek transformer implementations.


\section{Performance Optimization Results}

DeepSeek, zsRE & 2-6 & 10 & $95.2\%$ & $96.4\%$ & -- \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Scale Limitations}: Results identified practical scaling limits for effective editing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Llama-3.1}: Reliable performance up to 1000 edits on zsRE, 100 edits on CounterFact for maximum accuracy
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek}: Reliable performance limited to 100 edits on CounterFact, 10 edits on zsRE
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architecture-Specific Recommendations}: Layer selection guidelines based on empirical optimization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Llama-3.1}: Target layers 3-7 for optimal balance of editing effectiveness and knowledge preservation
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek}: Target layers 4-8 for CounterFact-style editing, layers 2-6 for zsRE-style editing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trade-offs and Optimization Boundaries}
\label{subsec:optimization_tradeoffs}

Analysis revealed fundamental trade-offs inherent in mass memory editing:

\textbf{Accuracy vs Scale Trade-off}: Increasing editing scale systematically degraded all performance metrics, with neighborhood accuracy showing the steepest decline. This pattern indicates that simultaneous modifications create interference effects that compound with scale.

\textbf{Generalization vs Preservation Trade-off}: Configurations optimizing rewrite accuracy often compromised neighborhood preservation, while settings preserving related knowledge showed reduced editing effectiveness. This trade-off appears fundamental to the MEMIT approach.

\textbf{Model Capacity vs Brittleness Trade-off}: Llama's superior scaling robustness came with increased computational overhead and longer processing times, while DeepSeek's efficiency was offset by brittle behavior at larger scales.

Figure~\ref{fig:optimal_configurations} summarizes the optimal configurations and their performance limitations across all experimental conditions.

\section{Summary of Key Findings}
\label{sec:key_findings}

\subsection{Primary Research Outcomes}
\label{subsec:primary_outcomes}

The comprehensive experimental evaluation yielded several critical insights:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Model Architecture Dominates Performance}: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct consistently outperformed DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B across all experimental conditions, with effect sizes exceeding Cohen's $d = 1.2$.

    \item \textbf{Scaling Exhibits Critical Thresholds}: Both models showed distinct scaling regimes with critical transition points around 100-1000 edits where performance degradation accelerated.

    \item \textbf{Layer Selection Enables Significant Optimization}: Optimal layer configurations (3-7 for Llama, 4-8 for DeepSeek) improved performance by 15-25\% compared to suboptimal selections.

    \item \textbf{Dataset Format Affects Editing Difficulty}: zsRE's relation extraction format proved more challenging for DeepSeek but more amenable to Llama, suggesting model-specific dataset compatibility.

    \item \textbf{Memory Interference Follows Predictable Patterns}: Neighborhood accuracy degraded most rapidly with scale, indicating that editing interference primarily affects related knowledge rather than target modifications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Practical Implications}
\label{subsec:practical_implications}

The results establish practical guidelines for deploying MEMIT in real-world applications:

\textbf{Recommended Operating Regimes}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Llama-3.1 architecture for applications requiring robust scaling beyond 100 edits
    \item Limit DeepSeek applications to small-scale editing (10-100 edits) with careful layer selection
    \item Target layers 3-7 (Llama) or 4-8 (DeepSeek) for optimal performance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Application-Specific Guidelines}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CounterFact-style factual updates: Achievable at moderate scale (100-1000 edits) with proper configuration
    \item Relation extraction modifications: More challenging, requiring careful model selection and scale limitation
    \item Knowledge preservation priority: Use conservative scaling with extensive neighborhood evaluation
\end{itemize}

These findings provide the empirical foundation for understanding MEMIT's capabilities and limitations, informing both theoretical development and practical deployment of neural model editing technologies.
